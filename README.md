# HanoiTower

This is a graphical rendition of the Hanoi Tower problem in C. The objective of the game is to move all the disks from the leftmost tower over to the rightmost tower, but you cannot place a larger disk onto a smaller disk.
This program uses funcitons, for loops and global variables to keep track of current state of pegs, then uses callbacks and recursion to calcaute the next step to take. A display function is used to scan through text lines and output a real time graphical representation of the current state of the towers
